However, we were very wrong with our predictions on what would be easy to solve. This weekend was punctuated by another blizzard. (Winter has been unusually harsh this year, even for Minnesota.) While that gave us a lot of time inside to solve puzzles, it also threw a wrench in our plans for attempting Taskmaster this week.

Because legalization or at least decriminalization seems so close at hand I thought I would write up a little experiental guide on how to avoid negative consequences. Hi all! I'm a newish DM and need some help. I'd like to know where to go from here, especially with regards of Strahd re-earning the party's trust. My campaign so far has been. complex. due to players leaving. The initial group ran Death House and loved it. They skipped most of the content of Barovia, met Irena and Ismark and buried the late Burgomaster. Strahd attended the burial from the shadows. Ismark had warned the party about the vampire in the basement of the chapel, and the group. # Respect K.O.

A "to be" phenomenon if you will. Now, to geek out on the details, I got one of those ancient cassette tapes today titled "weird". I know I‚Äôm a little late to the party talking about the Alter Ego concert but I‚Äôm rewatching it for the millionth time and I noticed they did an unusual intro to Time Is Running Out. Does anyone know what that is/where it‚Äôs from/if they‚Äôve done it before?

So, a while ago, I did a survey on the Danganronpa Executions for a post I was planning to make, to make sure that I was accurately representing the opinions of the majority and not just my own. While I did find out that my opinions were a load of horsedump, I also got a ton of interesting data about the different executions from all games, which I will display now to you. There was only. one problem. You see, for a series with more than 22 executions in the games, there. Who is the Ultimate Interviewer, u/Zanthosus? And where did the name ‚ÄúZanthosus‚Äù come from? I‚Äôm nothing special. I‚Äôm just a young adult nerd who enjoys anime, murder mystery books, and Survivor. Surprisingly, I‚Äôm not too big in to video games anymore (despite what my Steam library would lead you to believe). I live life one day at a time and pretty much just go with the flow and roll with the punches as they come. The name ‚ÄúZanthosus‚Äù has a pretty stupid origin. 10 years ago, my little. I know it doesn't really matter anymore, either way. Not that I've ever been one to talk about particularly important parts of the lore. But I never understood why people abandoned this theory. The more we learn about William, the more reasonable it seems. The main reason I can't let go is because of all the Phone Guy Easter eggs in FNaF 4, a game in which Scott claimed every Easter egg had a meaning. In other words, BV having a purple toy phone wasn't an accident. Neither was the Phone

So, today I got a new pair of Audio Technica COR150, they are inears, and they're not a big deal like other ones of course, but I'm in love with them, they're not much 'stylish' and that makes me love them more because it's a brand which focus 100% in audio quality, and I think they are doing it very good.
