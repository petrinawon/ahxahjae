So by now nearly all of you have seen these "leaks" doing the rounds. If you have not, here's a summary of them: Euron's fleet take down Rhaegal Jame betrays the North and Missande is captured. Dany's army captures Jaime and Brienne can't reason with him Sansa tells Tyrion that Jon is a Targaryen and he tells Varys. Vary's betrays Dany because he thinks Jon would be a better King.

We all have heard those stories where somebody Google Translated something, retranslated it back and got a completely different word or sentence, mostly for comedic effect. Well, what if we did that to College Football teams? What would the new team names be? Would you still support your team? A couple of ground rules: Every team name will start in English, then be translated through ten languages before being translated back to English. The order will therefore be as follows: English –°–∫–∞—á–∞—Ç—å –ø–µ—Å–Ω—é U.K. - Roadrunner –±–µ—Å–ø–ª–∞—Ç–Ω–æ –≤ mp3. –ü–∞—Ä–∞–º–µ—Ç—Ä—ã —Ñ–∞–π–ª–∞: 320 kbps, 9,69 mb, 4:14, –î–∞—Ç–∞ —Ä–µ–ª–∏–∑–∞: 5.07.2015. 
 I just want to know the basic items that I should have. I live on the border of the rural-suburban Philadelphia area so I'm always in civilization. So far I have in my car: All year: - water - first aid kit - jumper cables (planning on upgrading to the rechargeable box with a USB and 120 volt receptacle) - pocket knife with seatbelt cutter and window breaker - fire extinguisher - flashlight - batteries - small toolbox my company gave me.

Note: I‚Äôm on mobile, sorry about the formatting. Background: this is at the library again where I‚Äôm with 2 friends, Kylie and Logan (not real names). I have ADHD and Asperger‚Äôs syndrome, and I get nervous when in confrontations. I‚Äôm a 17 year old boy, my friends are both 16. This is my very first encounter with an EP, back when I had sensory issues. Story time: so during summer vacation, I went to the library for a while with Kylie and Logan. I checked out 5 movies, all of which are violent.

Studio D‚Äôartisan Fox-002 Roadrunner Denim Review By Alitxtile Studio D‚Äôartisan recently released a number of items made from unbleached undyed cotton that has beautiful natural colors in both a rusty-reddish-brown (coyote) and a khaki-green-tan (roadrunner). I‚Äôve had the jacket and the jeans for about a couple months and wanted to give an initial review of them each. For any history nerds present, I thought I‚Äôd give, in the comments, a little historical background to these cottons –°–∫–∞—á–∏–≤–∞–π—Ç–µ U.K. - Roadrunner –≤ mp3 –±–µ—Å–ø–ª–∞—Ç–Ω–æ –∏–ª–∏ —Å–ª—É—à–∞–π—Ç–µ –ø–µ—Å–Ω—é U.K. - Roadrunner –æ–Ω–ª–∞–π–Ω.
