I’ve been playing for about 6 months now and was looking into a drum machine of sorts. Something to loop drum beats and play to. Any recommendations. Hey guys, I'm thinking about ways to speed up my beatmaking in Ableton. Do you (and the PROs) use more drum loops or do you program the beats with samples? I'm looking for a method that's fast but lets me create drum fills and changes as well. amp#x200B; I've used both in the past, loops sound great but making drops and variations is a lot of work, if doable at all. Samples leave a lot of freedom but take much more time to program. Also it's easy to get lost and waste time when auditioning. I just noticed and I'm amazed.

Why? . . . I grew tired of being a working sideman drummer type dude, living Hello, Hoping to get some help here. I'm looking into writing some solo songs in the indie rock/pop genre (stuff like foals, arctic monkeys, hippo campus) but am having trouble finding drum loops that fit the genre. So far, I've tried EZ Drummer and it doesn't seem to have the "pack" that I want in terms of sound. I do not know how to play drums and have heard MIDI/editing being the way to go but it seems like there's a steep learning curve. Can anyone point me in the right direction? http://ssalvador.bandcamp.com/album/hate-hurts. 
I'm looking to do perform some covers however I find a lot of them aren't sounding right with just vocals and guitar. I'd love to be able to run a simple drum loop and possibly with a looper for layering I used to own a RC20XL which was just okay. I have a Digitech Trio which is a step in the right direction but has some practical pieces that are a pain (bass is always all over the place, can't record and teach the pedal at the same time). I've been looking at the BeatBuddy but I'm also wonderi. </p>
